# Space-Adventure-Game
#### It's a version of the popular Lunar Landing Game</br>https://youtu.be/QG8yRKZD7iE</br>

## Welcome to Space Adventure ü§ó</br>
Your objective in this game is to move the orange tile with the Astronaut emoji to the middle tile where the Earth emoji is.</br>
You can only move in Up, Down, Left and Right directions.</br>
First select:</br>
 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è - for up direction</br>
 ‚¨áÔ∏è - for down direction</br>
 ‚¨ÖÔ∏è - for left direction</br>
 ‚û°Ô∏è - for right direction</br>
and then tap on the tile you want to move (only Astronaut and Alien tiles can move).</br>
But the Astronaut and the Alien tiles can only move by moving straight into another Astronaut or Alien tile.</br>
You can not move into the walls of the board otherwise your tile will be lost in the space forever...</br></br>
May no one gets lost in the space!</br></br>
Have Fun!</br>
